/**
 * Team vault sync service.
 *
 * Team vaults are cloud-only (online-only). The XChaCha20-Poly1305 key is held in
 * memory for the session; never written to the OS keychain.
 *
 * Key management:
 *   - initTeamVaultKey()          ← called once when sharing is enabled
 *   - getTeamVaultKey()           ← fetches from server (or hits in-memory cache)
 *   - distributeKeyToNewMember()  ← wraps key for a new member
 *
 * Data management:
 *   - fetchTeamData()  ← download + decrypt + populate Zustand store slices
 *
 * Team objects are written per row by saveTeamVaultObject (see
 * teamObjectPersistence.ts). The legacy whole-blob writer was removed with #229:
 * uploading collected store state would turn a row this client failed to decrypt
 * into a deletion for the whole team.
