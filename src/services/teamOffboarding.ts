 *   device — and only suppresses the "you were removed" notice.
 * - `self-deleted` is a team this client destroyed while owning it (make
 *   private, or a rolled-back conversion). Nothing was taken away: the objects
 *   now live locally under the *same* ids, so an offboarding would wipe the
 *   user's own credentials and tell them they were kicked (#249).
