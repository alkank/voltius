/**
 * Replacement for keyParity.test.ts's coverage over the four mobile screens moved
 * into plugins by task 15/16 — those screens' strings now live in each plugin's own
 * `i18n.ts` catalog (registered via `api.i18n.register`), not in the host's locale
 * files, so keyParity.test.ts no longer sees them at all.
 *
 * This enforces the same "en" ⇄ other-locale symmetry keyParity does, but scoped to
 * each catalog individually. What it does NOT catch:
 *  - a third-party plugin's catalog (this only globs src/plugins/*, i.e. first-party)
 *  - a plugin that never calls api.i18n.register at all (no catalog to check)
 *  - runtime-only interpolation vars ({{name}}) being wrong or mismatched across locales
 *  - a plugin shipping a catalog but never calling t() with some of its keys (dead keys)

// The full locale union, not `Object.keys(messages)` — deriving the check from the
// catalog's own keys means an *entirely absent* locale (no `fr` property at all,
// as opposed to `fr: {}`) produces zero assertions for it and the suite passes
// silently. Checking against this list turns "missing a locale" into a loud
// failure instead of a hole with no test in it.
//
// Derived from the host's own SUPPORTED_LOCALES (not a hand-copied literal union)
// so this can't drift out of sync the way api.ts's PluginLocale array-literal
// version could: TS doesn't reject an under-inclusive array against a union type,
// so a fifth locale added to localeStore.ts and forgotten here would otherwise
// never get checked. Test files aren't part of the plugin-bundle boundary
// api.ts has to respect, so importing the real store value (not just its type)
// is fine here.
