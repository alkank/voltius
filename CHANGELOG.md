# Changelog

All notable changes to Voltius are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.36.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Turkish localization.

### Fixed

- Replaced the title-bar sync icon's spin with a calmer animation: background syncs breathe instead of spinning, manual syncs draw a symmetric arc that finishes before showing the result.
- Kept reconnecting after a long outage and resumed when the network returned.
- Drew every status dot with one shared StatusDot primitive.

## [0.35.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Stop SSH config hosts being rewritten as another host and losing their credentials.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Show whether the far end of a port forward is listening.

### Fixed

- Reap auto-detected forwards instead of piling them up.

## [0.34.5] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- Let a plain drag select terminal text again over apps that report mouse events.
- Propagated connection close through port-forward tunnels, so a keep-alive no
  longer hangs a closed connection.

## [0.34.4] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Stopped glyph fallback fonts from setting terminal row height, which made rows
  overlap when the configured font didn't load.
- Stopped the account quick switcher from listing the account already signed in.

## [0.34.3] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Let checkout request a specific plan, seat count and billing interval instead
  of defaulting to a single monthly plan.

### Fixed

- Unified the role editor and per-member permission overrides so both group and
  label every permission the same way.

## [0.34.2] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Sent free users to checkout, not the billing portal, and told the truth about limits.
- Showed the trial-expired modal, and led with what Pro gives.
- Stopped the minimap canvas from self-locking to 1x1 on sibling panes.
- Showed the renamed session name on cross-device session cards.

## [0.34.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Quieted member permission edits and grouped the permission list with a filter.
- Self-healed a stale team vault key wrap on key mismatch.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Added per-member permission overrides, with a confirmation when a change
  revokes vault-key access.
- Added draggable, char-precise text-selection handles on mobile, so a
  mis-dragged endpoint can be fixed without redoing the selection.

### Fixed

- Stopped the vault header from collapsing on narrow windows.

## [0.33.3] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Rotated the vault-header chevron on open and deduped the chevron-rotate style.

## [0.33.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Stopped the private vault's "+" button from opening the convert-to-team
  popover on hover.
- Labeled the share triggers, anchored the convert-to-team popover, and
  pinned the invite row.
- Clarified the "Manage" label and fixed the invite search field's contrast.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Removed the redundant "Vault settings" menu item and section.
- The Android keychain now resolves through the app classloader instead of
  `FindClass`, fixing a crash on some devices.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Rotate the team vault's encryption key whenever team membership changes.
- Reach vault admin directly from the vault.
- Encrypt team vault object metadata.
- Offboarding and invite lifecycle management, closing the keychain leak left
  behind on member removal.
- Vault invite links, and an explicit Share verb.

### Fixed

- Entity file loads now fail loudly instead of swallowing errors.
- Make-private no longer reports itself as a removal.
- The username of a host and of a keychain identity no longer picks up a
  capital first letter on macOS. Typing `abcd` and clicking away left `Abcd`
  behind, and an SSH username is case-sensitive, so the host was saved with a
  different login than the one that was typed. Fields you name yourself, such
  as a connection or a snippet name, keep the normal macOS behaviour.
- Converting a team vault back to private keeps its object ids, instead of
  orphaning every secret in it.
- Deleting a vault actually deletes its contents.
- Team offboarding failures are no longer swallowed silently.
- Wrapped user secrets now carry per account, fixing vault unwrap across an
  account switch.
- Invites are pre-checked against the enforced seat cap.
- Make-private now tells the truth about what it did, and stops losing data.
- Closed the last silent private-to-team conversion.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- A member holding only the `connect-only` role can now actually connect. The
  role could see every host in a team vault and reach none of them that needed
  a stored password, private key, or key passphrase: fetching the vault key and
  the stored credentials both required "View secrets", which the role does not
  grant, so the credentials never reached the device and every connection
  failed authentication. Connecting now means "use a stored credential without
  seeing it" — "View secrets" still governs reading one back in plain text, and
  "Copy secrets" the clipboard. Editors opened by a role without "View secrets"
  leave the credential fields blank and say why rather than showing the secret,
  and an export carries only the secrets its author is allowed to see. Requires
  a server that grants the same, so self-hosted installs should update the
  server alongside the app.
- A team vault whose stored credentials could not be loaded now says so. The
  hosts in a team vault are listed from data that needs no key, so the vault
  rendered complete and the first sign of trouble was an authentication failure
  at connect time. The vault stays browsable and warns in place instead.
- Updated browserslist past GHSA-73wf-gq98-2v4g.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Tabs can be renamed. A tab can now carry a name of your own instead of
  always showing the connection it opened: click the label of the tab you are
  already on, double-click it, or pick "Rename…" from the tab context menu or
  the pane header menu. Clearing the name returns the tab to the connection
  name, so a connection renamed upstream only ever moves the fallback. The name
  is device-local but survives a restart, and a shared session co-attached on
  another device inherits the name the origin device gave it. Duplicating a tab
  opens on the connection rather than inheriting the name.
- Split tabs have their own context menu. Right-clicking a unified split tab
  did nothing — only the session-tab button carried a menu, so a session merged
  into a split lost the one its own tab had. The new menu is tab-scoped:
  broadcast input, focus one of the tab's panes, split apart into tabs, and
  close the tab with its session count. Anything acting on a single session
  stays on the pane header, where the target is unambiguous.
- Mobile now shows team-vault first-access state. The mobile shell rendered
  none of it, so a member who opened a team vault they had no key for saw an
  empty hosts list with no explanation, and the role-aware landing never fired.
  The panel is now mounted on mobile too, with the header kept above it — it
  owns the only route to the vault switcher, without which a member stuck on a
  keyless vault could never reach another one. A live terminal or SFTP
  connection stays alive underneath.

### Fixed

- Ctrl+G reaches the shell again when the search widget is closed, so
  bash's Ctrl+R reverse-i-search can be aborted — readline needs the ^G byte
  (0x07) and it was never sent. The terminal claimed the chord unconditionally
  rather than only while its search widget was open, which killed every shell
  and TUI use of the key. Ctrl+G and Ctrl+F also no longer fire twice with the
  search open: one press moved two hits, and Ctrl+F focused the right panel's
  search bar over the widget it had just opened.
- An open context menu no longer swallows the next right-click. The menu sat
  above a full-screen backdrop that also caught the right-click meant for
  whatever was under it, so with one menu open, right-clicking another target
  did nothing at all and the stale menu simply stayed. A left-click outside now
  also reaches what it lands on rather than being absorbed.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- The option menus across the app now behave alike. The font picker, the
  keychain's key selector, the vault picker, the serial port list and the
  snippet row's menu each positioned and painted themselves, so they missed
  what the shared picker surface already did: re-measuring while the form
  panel scrolls, flipping above the trigger when there is no room below, and
  becoming a bottom sheet on Android. They are now drawn from the same parts as
  every other dropdown, on the same tokens, radii and icon sizes. The snippet
  row's "move to folder" step is a submenu rather than a second menu, and the
  mobile terminal bar's panels menu closes when you tap outside it — until now
  only tapping an item closed it.

### Fixed

- Pasting a directory in the file browser now uses tar acceleration. Copy/paste
  and cut/paste hardcoded it off, so they always fell back to per-file SFTP even
  when both ends supported tar, and never marked the transfer as accelerated —
  dragging the same directory between the panes was fast, pasting it was slow.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- The font pickers now list the fonts actually installed on your machine.
  Where Appearance and the theme editor offered two bundled presets and a
  free-text box, they now enumerate the installed families, preview each one
  in its own face, and filter the terminal picker to monospaced faces with a
  "show all fonts" escape hatch — some fonts misreport their pitch, and Nerd
  Fonts' non-Mono variants report proportional. The free-text box stays, and
  now warns when the family it holds is not installed instead of silently
  falling back to a proportional default.
- A serial console can hand its port back without losing the tab. The status
  bar gains a plug toggle that releases /dev/ttyUSB0 — keeping the tab, its
  scrollback and its configuration — and reopens it on the next click, so a
  board can be flashed without closing anything. Beside it is an
  auto-reconnect toggle, stored on the connection so it survives a restart and
  follows the device; with it off, a drop leaves the port free rather than
  reclaiming it every few seconds under the flashing tool.
- Sharing a private vault now asks before it converts. Adding one person used
  to create a team, link the vault and switch it to cloud sync with no dialog;
  inviting someone now opens a modal stating the three costs first — no
  offline access, members keep a copy of the vault key that removal does not
  take back, and no way back to private — and states that the vault's existing
  contents move with it.

### Fixed

- A custom terminal font no longer stretches the cells. A family typed into
  the theme editor carried no generic fallback, so when it failed to resolve,
  the canvas measured the cell from its own proportional default: cells came
  out about 1.6x too wide while the glyphs still painted at the right size.
  Terminal font stacks now end in `monospace` unless they already carry a
  generic family.
- A snippet with a choice variable asks which option to use. The parser hands
  a choice its first option as the default, and anything with a default
  counted as resolved, so `{{env:choice:dev,staging,prod}}` ran as `dev` and
  the other options were unreachable. The picker now always opens, pre-filled
  with the first option.
- A team member whose role cannot read secrets no longer sees "Access
  revoked". A connect-only member holds no VIEW_SECRETS, so the vault-key
  route answers 403 — which the client read as removal from the team. They
  now get the vault, empty, like any other empty vault.
- Converting a private vault from the share sheet no longer empties it for
  everyone else. The conversion created the team and the key but left the
  vault's contents behind under the old id: the owner still saw the hosts
  while every teammate saw an empty vault, with no warning. Both conversion
  paths now migrate the contents, and do it as a group — a failure unlinks the
  vault and deletes the team rather than leaving a vault that looks complete
  to its owner and empty to everyone else.
- A vault you have just joined unlocks by itself when its key arrives. The
  waiting panel was honest but permanent: nothing re-read the key that had
  landed until you hit Retry or restarted. It also now names who it is waiting
  for, and a member arriving for the first time lands on the surface their
  role can actually use — a connect-only invitee gets connections, not a
  keychain of redacted rows.
- Typing `exit` on a remote shell no longer reconnects it. The close event
  carried no reason, so a deliberate exit and a dropped link looked
  identical; the far side's exit-status is now carried through, and a session
  that ended on purpose stays ended.
- A snippet run from the command palette lands in the focused tab. The target
  was resolved as the first connected session in tab order, so with several
  tabs open a snippet always went to tab 1.
- A plugin installed from the catalogue can be disabled like a bundled one.
  The enable toggle rendered only on bundled rows, so installing a plugin that
  also ships with the app took its toggle away, and themes — which are only
  ever installed — never had one.
- A plugin installed from the catalogue now activates. One whose manifest set
  `defaultEnabled: false` loaded inactive and contributed nothing, which is
  why installing a marketplace theme added no theme to the Appearance list.
  Installing is itself the opt-in; an explicit choice to disable is still
  honoured, including across a reload that previously re-enabled it.
- The role picked for an invitee reaches them. The role was assigned in a
  follow-up call that 404s against a pending invitation, and the error was
  swallowed, so every invitee landed on the default role. Alongside it: a
  failed invite no longer reports success, an invite with no role selected is
  refused rather than falling back to "member", a sync server that cannot be
  reached no longer leaks its URL into the error text, seats no longer render
  "? available · ? total" when the subscription load fails, text on accent
  backgrounds stays readable under a dark accent, and the vault header's
  member stack is reachable by keyboard and touch.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Your settings are now yours to sync group by group and setting by setting.
  Settings → Sync gains a second block, "Settings", below the existing Sync
  Preferences block that already governed hosts, identities, keys and the rest.
  It carries one switch per group — Themes, Interface, Shortcuts, App settings,
  Recent people — and each individual setting gains a cloud button in its own
  row's hover controls, so a single value can stay on this device without
  switching its whole group off. A held-back value never enters the uploaded
  backup, and a copy already on the server is withdrawn when you switch the
  setting off. Each group also lists what it is keeping local, which is the
  only control for the handful of settings that have no row of their own.
- The default shell is no longer synced unless you ask for it. A shell path is
  wrong on another machine by construction, so it is now device-scoped: it
  stays out of the backup until you opt it in from the Sync panel.
- Your sunrise/sunset coordinates are no longer synced unless you ask for
  them to be. Where you physically are is a property of the machine, not of
  your account, so the theme location is now device-scoped: it stays out of
  the uploaded backup — and out of any third-party sync destination, such as
  the gist-sync plugin — until you opt it in from the cloud button beside the
  latitude and longitude fields.
- Snippets now have their own cloud sync switch. The Sync Preferences block
  gains a Snippets row alongside Hosts, Identities, SSH Keys, Folders and Port
  Forwarding, so the whole collection can stay off the backup — individual
  snippets could already be excluded one at a time from their card. Switching
  Folders off now also stops snippet folders syncing, which is what their cards
  already showed.
- Terminal font size is now a setting of its own in Appearance, overriding the
  active theme, where before changing it meant cloning a theme or scaling the
  whole UI. On mobile a two-finger pinch on the terminal drives the same value.
  It stays on this device — a size that reads well on a phone does not read
  well on a desktop — so it is never synced.

### Changed

- Because the default shell now stays out of the uploaded backup, a device
  still running 0.29.x will have its own default shell cleared back to the
  system default. That older release reads an absent shell as "clear it", and
  it happens again on every later settings change made on an updated device,
  until the older device updates too. Devices on this release are unaffected,
  and the setting itself is never lost — only the older device's copy is
  reset to the default.

### Fixed

- Three Russian strings read wrong. The Interface sync group described itself
  with "раскладки", which reads first as *keyboard* layouts — an active
  collision in a panel that also has a Shortcuts group — and the same word was
  used for terminal panes; both now say what they mean. "Недавние люди" became
  "Недавние контакты", which is what the counts beside it already said.
- Pasting went to the wrong terminal. With more than one terminal on screen,
  the paste landed in whichever session the pane had opened last rather than
  the one that received the keystroke.
- Your own tmux works inside a persistent session again. A persistent session
  wraps the remote shell in Voltius's own tmux, and that wrapper leaked its
  socket and its `C-b` prefix into the shell: `tmux ls` listed Voltius's
  private sessions instead of yours, `tmux attach` refused to nest at all, and
  a forced nest lost every prefix key. The wrapper now clears the multiplexer
  environment and gives up its prefix. The fix reaches new sessions; a session
  started before this release keeps the old wrapper until it is restarted.
- On a host that has screen but not tmux, the wrapper no longer swallows
  `C-a`. A bare `C-a d` inside your own nested screen detached Voltius's
  session instead, closing the connection and reconnecting underneath you.
- Duplicating a session no longer lands in your home directory when the
  original's working directory has since been deleted. The directory probe
  read the kernel's `<path> (deleted)` form verbatim, so the duplicate's `cd`
  could never succeed; it now falls back to the nearest directory that still
  exists. The same stale path also reached the stored working directory and
  the file panel's follow-cwd.
- Exporting or deploying a key whose public half was never stored no longer
  fails with "Public key not found". The public half is derived from the
  private key instead.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- An account signed in to a self-hosted instance is now named as such. The
  switcher row and the account header show the instance host instead of a
  generic "Cloud", with the full URL on hover, and the auth screen's server
  field seeds from the instance this machine last used — so "Add another
  account…" no longer quietly aims a self-hosted user back at the official
  cloud. Rows on the official cloud are unchanged.

### Fixed

- The account switcher no longer loses accounts to the platform keychain's
  size limit. Windows Credential Manager refuses a value over 2560 bytes,
  which two accounts' tokens exceeded on their own, and the rejection was
  swallowed: adding a second account saved nothing, and switching back came
  up with no tabs. Accounts are now stored one entry each, workspace state
  parks in local storage, failures surface as a toast instead of silence, and
  an older single-value list migrates on first read. Restoring a workspace
  also waits for the login sync, so reconnecting no longer errors every
  restored tab.
- A shared team vault's card in the dashboard's Vaults section counted no
  hosts, even though the same hosts were listed everywhere else.
- Installing a snippet from a link writes it to the vault the confirm sheet
  named, even if the vault selection changed while the sheet was open.
- Accepting a plugin-install link while the same plugin was already
  installing from Settings reported success without writing anything; the
  second install is now refused.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Voltius is packaged for four more channels: the AUR (`voltius-bin`), Flathub,
  Scoop and the Microsoft Store. The Store build installs without the unknown-
  publisher warning Windows shows for the standalone installer.
- Deep links reach more of the app. Notifications, settings and billing each
  have a route, and an invitation by handle, a snippet install or a plugin
  install now opens a confirmation sheet that names exactly what it is about to
  do before anything is applied.
- Links work in their `https://voltius.app/open` form as well as the
  `voltius://` scheme, so they survive the chat clients and mail readers that
  strip custom schemes. On Android that address is registered as an App Link and
  opens the app directly. Sharing an invitation hands out the https form.
- Presence is drawn by one component everywhere it appears — the title bar, the
  share menu, session cards and the member list — so a teammate looks the same
  wherever you run into them.

### Fixed

- The Linux `.deb` declares its dependency on libsecret, which it linked against
  without asking for. On a minimal Debian the app failed to start.
- The generated desktop entry carries a category, so Voltius is filed under
  Development instead of landing in whatever bucket a launcher uses for
  uncategorised apps.
- A confirmation sheet queued behind another no longer inherits the click that
  dismissed the first one, and changing language while one is open no longer
  re-runs its load.
- A plugin install link whose integrity check fails is reported as tampering
  rather than as a malformed link.
- The `/open` App Link matches exact paths instead of a prefix, so the rest of
  voltius.app opens in the browser again.
- The notification bell re-measures when the set of mounted bells changes,
  fixing a popover that could point at the wrong bell on mobile.
- Very small avatars keep their initials legible instead of shrinking them into
  nothing.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Voltius now answers `voltius://` links. A session invite, a team invite or an
  email verification opens the app straight on the thing it points at, on
  desktop and on mobile. Links are routed through a table that classifies each
  one by how much it is trusted, and a link that arrives before you are signed
  in is queued and replayed once you are. Verifying your email no longer needs
  the manual "I've verified" click.
- Live session invites can be read out loud: alongside the link, a share now
  offers a short spoken code that a teammate can type into the join field.
- Vault backups are visible. When a save is quarantined because it could not be
  opened, the vault panel lists the kept backups with their real sizes and
  offers to restore one, instead of leaving them as files on disk you were never
  told about.
- The People section in the share menu reads as clickable, and Recent entries
  can be pruned.

### Fixed

- A cloud vault is unlocked with the key that actually encrypted it, and that
  key survives re-authenticating with the cloud. Signing back in no longer
  leaves the vault unopenable on the device that created it.
- The vault never deletes `secrets.enc` when no key opens it, writes it
  atomically so an interrupted save cannot truncate it, and stops retention from
  deleting backups a recovery run never attempted.
- Vault failures are told apart from missing data: "vault unavailable" is no
  longer read as "no credentials saved", the locked-store error from the Rust
  side carries the vault-locked code, and that code survives the reconnect loop.
  A form now says outright when a secret could not be read instead of showing a
  blank field.
- Sync now carries the vault list — which vaults exist and what they are
  called — in the encrypted blob, so a second device stops showing objects whose
  vault it cannot name.
- A new vault key is uploaded before the vault is re-encrypted to it, so a
  failure mid-rotation cannot strand the vault.
- An account with no password whose vault cannot be read is sent to recovery,
  and the vault is unlocked before the legacy migration runs.
- Connecting from the SFTP side pane while the vault is locked now shows the
  vault panel rather than failing silently.
- The account quick switcher no longer carries one account's state into
  another's, signing out drops the saved credentials, and the rest of an
  account's local state moves with the account. Reaching a second account from
  the switcher works again.
- Auto-lock is reachable from the account menu.
- An invite link stays reachable after the share menu closes, presence is shown
  on Recent rows with a dot that actually paints, the members popover floats
  above the header, and your own presence is trusted.
- The invite search says it accepts handles, not just email; the members popover
  title is translated in Russian and Chinese.
- A button's ripple releases its listeners and timers when the button unmounts.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Selecting terminal text with "Select to Copy" enabled now copies even when
  the mouse button is released outside the terminal — in the window padding,
  over another pane, or past the window edge. Dragging right to left and
  overshooting the left border no longer silently loses the selection.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Share a terminal with anyone, not just teammates. The share menu's new People
  tab finds teammates as you type, and anyone else by their @handle or full
  email address. The invite *is* the request: the person gets a notification
  with Join, Decline and Block permanently, and joining is one tap. A host can
  withdraw a pending invite — which frees the guest seat instead of holding it
  until the session ends — and the guest cap is visible while inviting. People
  you invited recently are remembered across your devices, carried in your
  encrypted sync blob rather than stored on the server.
- Every account has an @handle. It shows in the account menu with a copy
  button, avatars fall back to two-letter initials from it, and Settings can
  claim or rename a custom one — all it takes is a verified email address.
  Choosing a custom handle is what makes you findable by people outside your
  teams; the handle you start with already works for anyone you give it to. A
  toggle controls whether people outside your teams may invite you at all.
- The MCP server gained the settings, account, plugin-management and
  marketplace domains: an agent can read and change settings, read your
  subscription, install and manage plugins, browse marketplace sources, export
  and import vault objects, and read a team's server-side audit log. Each
  domain sits behind its own permission and writes audit rows. The ssh-config
  sync is now exposed as an MCP tool.
- Terminal appearance gained line-height, cursor-style and cursor-blink
  settings, and they sync across devices.

### Removed

- The display-name editor is gone. A handle is the single name Voltius shows
  for a person, everywhere.

### Fixed

- Sharing a local shell relayed nothing — guests joined a permanently blank
  terminal. Input and output now flow both ways.
- Your email address is no longer sent over the session WebSocket, where every
  participant could read it; a stranger admitted by a knock previously learned
  everyone's real address.
- A stranger sees no session name until they accept, so a mis-aimed invite
  leaks a handle rather than a hostname, and a knock is labelled from the
  server's record of who sent it rather than a name the sender chose.
- Session and vault keys are wrapped to the recipient's current public key,
  fixing invites that failed for someone who had signed in on another device.
- A rate-limited sign-in reported "Account not found", sending people off to
  create a second account they did not need.
- Settings pulled from another device no longer bounce straight back as a push.
- Closing the window during a shutdown sync could cancel the exit, or close a
  window you had just reopened.
- The cursor keeps blinking under persistent tmux and screen sessions, and the
  GNU screen fallback gets TrueColor.
- The account dropdown no longer waits on a network handle lookup before it
  opens, and signing out clears the cached handle.
- The session guest cap is applied consistently — in the invite-to-session
  menu, in the direct-invite roster, and across the setup-to-active flip.
- Numerous MCP corrections: tighter permission gates on the settings, account
  and team-audit surfaces, audit rows that no longer carry more than they
  should, and stores refreshed before an export reads them.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- A notification inbox collects everything a team throws at you in one place:
  pending invitations, sessions a teammate shared with you, and requests for
  control of a session you are hosting. Each entry is actionable — accept,
  decline, join, grant or deny without hunting for the right screen — and
  resolves itself when the underlying event goes away, so the rail no longer
  polls for shares. On mobile the bell is reachable from every tab.
- Sessions gained one join affordance instead of several, plus an empty state
  that explains what a team session is. An invite code pasted into the default
  search bar now joins that session directly.
- The MCP server gained the team and sharing domains, taking its verb surface
  to 74: an agent can read a team and its members, change a member's role,
  share a session, and revoke a share. The same domains are exposed on
  PluginAPI. Both sets of verbs sit behind their own permission, and every
  membership or sharing call writes an audit row naming the counterparty.
- A session whose MCP client disconnected is now shown as disconnected rather
  than silently live, and the next client can adopt it.

### Fixed

- Accepting or declining an invitation closes the modal only once the call
  succeeds, so a failure no longer looks like it worked.
- A denied control request stays denied until the guest asks again, control
  requests are retracted when the session ends, and landing control on yourself
  now confirms with a toast.
- Hosts are no longer notified about their own share, and a session you left
  stops showing up as unresolved.
- Join is no longer offered on mobile, where a joined session cannot render.
- A team whose vault key has not reached you yet shows an honest
  waiting-for-access state instead of reporting the session as not found.
- The share menu copies the invite code it actually displays, auto-copies on
  generate, and remembers that it did.
- `member_set_role` is callable again, and fails loudly when the roles cannot
  be reloaded instead of reporting a change it did not make.
- Membership verbs send their audit rows to the team server, where they were
  previously dropped.
- A broadcast share is refused before the audit row is written, not after.

### Changed

- After a lagged sync event the session list refetches once, rather than on
  every sync.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- A session can be duplicated straight into a new tab or a split, from the tab's
  context menu or the command palette. The copy opens in the directory the
  original was sitting in, and a quick-connect session keeps the credentials it
  was opened with, so duplicating one no longer asks for a password again.
- The MCP server gained five pane verbs, taking its surface to 64: an agent can
  split a session into a pane, move a session between panes, detach a pane back
  into a tab, focus or maximize one, and toggle broadcast on a pane group. Every
  write is verified against the layout store before it reports success.

### Fixed

- Reconnecting a quick-connect session reused the credentials from the original
  connection instead of failing on a missing password.
- Windows no longer lists WSL as an available shell when no distribution is
  installed (`wsl.exe` ships with stock Windows, so its presence proved
  nothing).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- The MCP server can now send real keystrokes. `send_keys` types into any open
  session — literal text or named keys like `Enter`, `Up`, `Escape`, `C-c`,
  `F1`–`F12` — and returns the screen once it stops changing, so an agent can
  drive a full-screen program (top, less, fzf, vim, whiptail) that `run_command`
  structurally cannot: that verb wraps its input so it can read an exit code,
  and the wrapper is typed into such a program as literal text.
- Ten further verbs join it, taking the MCP surface from 48 to 59. Snippets can
  be run on a host, known hosts listed, trusted and deleted, and shell history
  searched across hosts. Transfers can be listed, cancelled and retried;
  configuration sync state and host reachability can be read.
- Transfers started over MCP now appear in your own transfer queue, marked with
  the name of the client that started them, and can be cancelled from there like
  any other transfer.
- Tabs a connected MCP client is driving are marked in the tab strip and the
  pane header, with the controlling client named in the tooltip, so it is always
  visible which sessions are not being driven by you.
- A failed transfer can be retried from the transfer queue.

### Fixed

- A local shell could come up blank, and starting the app a second time opened a
  second copy instead of focusing the running one.
- Opening a new split tab cloned the previous tab's terminals into it.
- A session opened by an MCP client no longer steals the tab you are working in.
- An SFTP handle evicted from the cache was dropped without being closed,
  leaking it on the server.
- A transfer being retried could be evicted from the queue mid-retry.
- Editing a port-forwarding rule or a snippet over MCP no longer needs the whole
  record restated, and a transfer that failed to start reports the real error
  instead of silently resolving.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- The MCP server gained eleven verbs, taking its own surface to 48: snippets and
  port-forwarding rules can now be listed, created, updated and deleted, and a
  rule's tunnels started, stopped and inspected. Updates read-modify-write the
  current record, so naming one field no longer blanks a snippet's steps. A rule
  in a team vault can have its tunnel started but not edited, and starting one
  needs the gated `ports:forward` grant.
- Every object the MCP surface returns now reports which vault and folder it is
  filed in, and `object_move` / `object_copy` report the destination they wrote
  to — so an agent can confirm where something landed instead of guessing.

### Fixed

- Saving a snippet with a transfer step failed for every user, in the app's own
  UI as much as over MCP ("missing field `direction`"). Transfer steps now
  round-trip their full shape, including mode and conflict handling; snippets
  saved under the old shape still load.
- The SFTP file pane's header and rows are laid out on one shared grid: columns
  no longer drift apart when resized, the pane scrolls sideways instead of
  clipping the right-hand columns out of reach, and column widths and visibility
  survive a pane remount.
- The right-panel SFTP tab now rides the terminal's own SSH connection. It used
  to dial a second one that died on sleep, failing every operation with "Channel
  send error" until the app restarted.
- Alt-clicking a link inside a TUI that opens URLs itself (Claude Code) opened
  it twice; OSC 8 hyperlinks opened nothing at all. Both now go through the same
  policy.
- Downloading a missing path from a container, or checking whether one exists,
  could report success when the command's exit status was lost.
- A host-to-host directory transfer used the same temp archive name on both
  ends, so a same-host transfer collided with itself.
- The WSL distro list rendered twice in the host picker.
- The host picker's NEW HOST button did nothing visible and is gone.
- The theme badge no longer shows a meaningless infinity glyph.
- MCP refusals are marked explicitly instead of inferred from result shape.
- Importing a key through the UI now validates its public half.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Republishes 0.21.0, whose release only carried the Windows x64 installers and
  the Android APK. A network failure part-way through the build split the
  release in two, so the macOS, Linux and Windows ARM downloads never appeared
  and the updater manifest offered an update to Windows x64 only. No
  application code changed between 0.21.0 and 0.21.1.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Published container ports are now clickable everywhere Docker lists them —
  the container list, the stack view and the mobile screen. Clicking one opens
  it in your browser, or copies the address; a port on a remote host is
  tunnelled to this machine first, automatically, and an existing tunnel is
  reused.
- The MCP server gained eleven verbs, taking its own surface to 37 (52 with the
  bundled plugins' tools). An agent can now organise your vault, not just read
  and write inside it: `vault_list/create/rename/delete`,
  `folder_list/create/rename/delete`, `object_move` and `object_copy` — the same
  cut/copy-and-paste the pages do, including whole folder subtrees — and
  `key_add_to_host`, which appends a saved key's public half to a host's
  `authorized_keys` over SSH. Deleting a vault or folder cascades, moving
  objects into a different vault has to be asked for explicitly, and team vaults
  are refused throughout.
- Plugins gained four new gated namespaces mirroring that surface: `api.vaults`,
  `api.folders`, `api.objects` and `api.ports.reach`. Object moves are gated per
  object type rather than wholesale — a plugin allowed to file snippets cannot
  move your keys — and snippets and port forwarding rules now have their own
  write permissions. Every new permission ships with plain-language consent
  copy, and the install dialog now distinguishes read-only grants (a container
  list, a vault name) from the destructive ones.

### Fixed

- Ad-hoc port forwarding tunnels no longer die when their host reconnects, and
  tunnel channels now open on the session's current SSH handle — after a sleep
  or a dropped link, forwarding kept using the handle that was already gone.
- File panes keep working after the SSH link behind them is replaced, instead
  of failing every operation until the tab is reopened.
- The titlebar no longer swallows clicks on the close and new-tab buttons.
- Docker no longer lists the same published port twice when it is bound on both
  IPv4 and IPv6, and pressing Enter on a port chip in the mobile view acts on
  the chip instead of the row behind it.
- `ssh_exec_command` now reports a command's exit code and stderr rather than
  presenting a failed command as a success — this silently affected Proxmox
  actions.
- An MCP tool call that the app refuses is now returned to the client as an
  error instead of a successful result carrying a refusal message.

### Security

- Pinned js-yaml to 4.3.1 or later, clearing CVE-2026-59870.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- A host's Shell integration override is now three-state — Inherit, On, Off —
  matching Persistent session. Before, the override could only turn shell
  integration off, so a host could never force it on while the global toggle was
  off. Existing hosts keep their behaviour: an override that said "disabled"
  becomes an explicit Off, everything else inherits.

### Fixed

- Closing the app no longer waits with the window still on screen while an
  enabled plugin runs its quit-time work — the Gist sync plugin's push to GitHub
  made closing take about two seconds. The window now closes immediately and the
  sync finishes in the background. Thanks to @Flash303 for the report and the
  fix.
- Persistent sessions now work against dropbear servers (OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt and
  other embedded targets). The bootstrap payload was base64-encoded twice and
  ran to 21,718 bytes with persistent sessions and shell integration both on,
  past dropbear's 9,000-byte limit, which killed the connection the moment
  authentication succeeded — the session appeared stuck on "Authenticating"
  forever.
- A host whose only Advanced override was Persistent session now shows the
  usual dirty dot when the section is collapsed, instead of hiding the override
  entirely. The two global toggle descriptions also name where the per-host
  overrides live.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Voltius can now act as an MCP server, so Claude Code and other MCP clients
  drive your infrastructure directly: 41 tools covering keys, identities,
  connections, sessions, commands and file transfers. It is off by default —
  turn it on in Settings → Integrations, which also carries the one-line client
  setup command and what granting a client this access means.
- Plugins can contribute their own MCP tools. With the server on, the bundled
  Docker, Proxmox, process manager and monitoring plugins contribute 15 verbs
  between them — container and image listings, LXC actions, snapshots, process
  listing and metrics — and each plugin can be excluded on its own.
- An MCP client can read its own audit trail through `audit_query`, behind a new
  danger-gated `audit:read` permission.
- Plugins get a gated SFTP file domain and a gated `api.mcp` capability for
  contributing tools.

### Fixed

- A Proxmox command that failed reported success. Creating, rolling back or
  deleting an LXC snapshot returned OK even when Proxmox refused the operation,
  so a rollback could target a snapshot that was never created.
- Creating a folder from the Snippets page put it in the Personal vault instead
  of the vault being viewed.
- Team-vault connections were adopted and rewritten by SSH config sync.
- Streaming a container's logs left a listener behind after the call finished.
- Russian was missing plural forms in the MCP integrations screen.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Pasting a host into another vault now carries its key and identity across, so
  the pasted host still connects instead of landing without credentials.
- `useT` and `useSessionById` are available to plugins from `@voltius/ui`.

### Fixed

- Renaming a folder moved it into the Personal vault. Any folder kept in another
  vault was silently relocated, taking everything filed in it along.
- Moving a key, identity, connection or folder to another vault unpinned it, as
  did renaming or reparenting a folder.
- Members of a team vault received a passphrase-protected connection key without
  its passphrase, so they could not connect. Both the current and the legacy
  storage paths now publish it.
- The folder picker in the host, serial-host, key and identity editors offered
  every page's folders, so a host could be filed into a keychain folder — the
  editor then showed it in a folder its own page does not list, leaving it
  sitting unfiled at the top level. Creating a folder from the key or identity
  editor made a host folder for the same reason.
- Pasting a copied object no longer appends "(copy)" when nothing of that name
  is there to collide with.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Plugins can record audit events through `api.audit.record`, behind a new
  danger-gated `audit` permission that has to be granted explicitly. The action
  set is closed, so a plugin cannot invent event types.
- `registerGlobalPanel` returns a control handle, letting a plugin open, close
  and resize its own panel.
- `ConnectionAvatar` and `ConfirmModal` are available to plugins from
  `@voltius/ui`.

### Fixed

- Pasting into another vault put the object back in the vault it came from.
  A vault's root now names that vault as the destination, so a paste there
  changes vault and asks for confirmation first. Cutting between two vault
  roots was also silently discarded as a no-op.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Cut, copy and paste for vault objects on Hosts, Keychain, Port Forwarding and
  Snippets — objects and folders alike. `Ctrl+X` / `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` by
  default, rebindable in Settings → Shortcuts, and offered in the right-click
  menu on a single item as well as on a multi-selection. A pill shows what is on
  the clipboard; `Escape` or its clear button empties it. Cut moves, copy
  duplicates, and the clipboard is kept after a copy so it can be pasted more
  than once.
- A paste that would move objects into a different vault asks for confirmation
  first, naming the destination.

### Changed

- Deleting a folder now deletes everything inside it, on every tab. Previously
  its contents were left behind — subfolders survived but became invisible.
  Because the delete now cascades, it can no longer be undone.
- A paste is refused when it would leave a reference pointing outside the
  destination vault: a host whose identity or key stays behind, a port
  forwarding rule whose host stays behind, or a snippet whose snippet-call
  target stays behind. Use "Move to vault", which brings the referenced objects
  along.

### Fixed

- Team vaults: moving any object out of a team vault failed with
  "Connection &lt;id&gt; not found".
- Team vaults: the write-permission check rejected every team vault as
  "Vault permission data is corrupted", and a team using a custom-named role
  with write permissions was refused locally even though the server allowed it.
- Team vaults: an object's password or key material stayed in the vault after
  the object left it, readable by everyone still in that vault. Removing an
  object from a team vault now removes its secrets too.
- Keychain: "Move to vault" and "Copy to vault" moved the key or identity
  without its key material, leaving it unusable in the destination.
- Snippets: folders belonging to a team vault were not shown on the Snippets
  page.
- Port forwarding: moving a rule between vaults gave it a new id, breaking
  anything that referenced it.
- Each paste is a single undo entry, and undo restores objects to the vault and
  folder they came from.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Snippets: a snippet's variable prompt was dismissed when the picker navigated
  away from the Snippets page, so the snippet ran with empty variables or did
  not run at all.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Hosts: a Pre/Post command can now be a saved snippet instead of a single
  inline command, and runs its whole sequence — multi-step, snippet calls and
  file transfers included. Pick one with the `{}` button beside either field.
  Snippet variables are prompted for on connect (and on disconnect for a
  post-command) and remembered per host; `password` variables are never
  remembered, and "Ask for variables each time" turns remembering off for a
  host. Inline commands are unchanged (#63).
- Snippets: a Community tab for browsing and installing snippets and packs from
  the public catalogue. Every step is shown exactly as it will run before you
  install, a snippet that calls another pulls its target in and says so, and
  what lands in your vault is a plain owned snippet.
- Snippets: "Share to community" on a snippet's or folder's menu turns it into a
  catalogue entry. Nothing is uploaded — you get the JSON to submit and a
  prefilled GitHub link. Before that it scans the steps for private keys,
  passwords, API tokens and routable hosts, and warns if it finds any.
- Hosts: the latency shown for a connected host is now measured over the SSH
  session itself instead of a separate connection.

### Fixed

- Hosts: connection status probing hammered hosts often enough that rate-limit
  firewalls (ufw `limit`, fail2ban) would lock users out of their own servers.
  Probes now run from a single scheduler with jitter, deduplicated per
  host:port, at much longer intervals (#90).
- Hosts: the status dot could flicker, and a stalled jump-host lookup could
  freeze a host's status indefinitely.
- Snippets: a snippet that calls another one imported as a dangling reference,
  because export carried a machine-local id. Nested calls now survive
  export/import, and an export that would produce a broken reference fails
  visibly instead of silently.
- Hosts: a post-command snippet resolved `{{connection.*}}` against the local
  shell instead of the host it just disconnected from.
- Hosts: when several snippet variables were prompted in a row, each prompt
  inherited the previous one's typed values, passwords included.
- Serial: the Pre/Post command fields on a serial connection were saved but
  never actually run, and closing a tab no longer waits for the port to be
  released.
- Links: external links on the signup screen, the changelog popup, the roles
  section and in Gist Sync did nothing when clicked. They now open in your
  browser.
- Themes: the drop shadow under page toolbars was a near-black smudge on light
  themes; it now follows the light-appearance shadow tokens.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- SSH: connecting with an RSA key to an older server — notably OpenWrt routers
  running dropbear before 2020.79 — was rejected even though the server accepts
  the key. The signature algorithm is now taken from what the server says it
  supports (#85).
- SSH: a server that accepted the connection but never answered the
  authentication request left the app on "Authenticating" forever. It now stops
  with an explanation instead of waiting indefinitely.
- Plugins: the built-in plugins reported an update was available when their code
  was already identical to the published one.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Plugins: if none of the built-in plugins can load, the app now says so instead
  of quietly showing an empty plugin list.

### Fixed

- Plugins: plugin names in the right-hand rail and in Settings now follow the
  language you pick, instead of staying in whichever language the app started in.
- Plugins: a plugin that was disabled could still briefly publish its state after
  being switched off.
- Icons: the Docker and GitHub icons were fetched over the network, so they were
  blank on a first launch without internet. Every icon now ships with the app.

### Removed

- Plugins: the unimplemented `sidebarItems` and `contextMenuItems` plugin APIs,
  along with their permissions. Use `ui.registerContribution` instead.

### Security

- The app window now runs under a content security policy, so a plugin can no
  longer load remote code or reach an arbitrary host directly (#84).
- Plugins: a plugin can no longer replace the app's own icons.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Windows: the app could not be packaged at all, so 0.14.0 produced no Windows
  installers. Everything in 0.14.0 reaches Windows users with this release.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Plugins: the six built-in plugins — SSH Config Sync, GitHub Gist Sync, Metrics,
  Docker, Proxmox LXC and Process Manager — now run as ordinary plugins on the
  public plugin API. You can disable, uninstall and reinstall any of them, and
  they can receive fixes without waiting for a full app release.
- Plugins: your installed-plugin list now syncs, and a new device restores it
  automatically.
- Plugins: finer-grained permissions. Docker, Proxmox and Processes now separate
  read-only access from management, and read-only permissions appear as their own
  tier in the install dialog instead of being flagged as destructive.
- Plugins: `api.i18n`, so plugin authors can translate their interface.
- Plugins: installs are checked against the plugin's minimum app version, and a
  plugin's stylesheet is verified against a published hash before it is applied.
- Sessions: right-click a remote session to kill it, with an undo window before
  it takes effect.

### Fixed

- Proxmox: snapshot names were read with a leading tree character, which broke
  rolling back and deleting snapshots (#83).
- Plugins: plugin ids are now validated consistently at install and load (#79).

### Security

- Docker: container and stack identifiers are now shell-quoted when building
  remote commands, so a name containing shell metacharacters cannot alter the
  command that runs on the host.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Simplified Chinese (简体中文) interface language, contributed by
  [@CoconutHR](https://github.com/CoconutHR). Pick it under Appearance settings;
  like every language, it syncs across your devices.
- Plugins: an update flow. Voltius now detects when an installed plugin has a
  newer version, offers a one-click update, and asks you to re-consent if the
  update declares permissions you had not already granted (#52).
- Plugins: bundle integrity. A plugin's bundle hash is verified on install and
  recorded, plugins that cannot be verified carry an "unverified" badge, and
  install failures are surfaced instead of failing quietly (#44).
- Plugins: new capabilities for plugin authors — session open/close lifecycle
  verbs, a streaming `http.stream` verb backed by server-sent events, terminal
  reading (snapshot and live stream), selection reading, and OS-keychain storage
  for plugin secrets.
- Plugins: two new UI surfaces — a shell-level panel mount and a reusable
  `titlebar.right` status-bar slot.
- Settings: plugin pages now appear as expandable children under the Plugins
  nav entry rather than as flat top-level items, on both desktop and mobile.
- SFTP: a "Copy path" action in the file-row context menu on desktop (#62).
- Sync: an exclusion filter, so objects you exclude are stripped from outbound
  sync on push, on pull merge, and from the gist-sync export path (#43, #47).
- Themes: Dracula and Monokai reworked with real elevation and text ramps
  instead of flat approximations (#40, #60).

### Fixed

- Terminal: the wheel and touchpad now scroll full-screen terminal apps (vim,
  less, htop) instead of doing nothing, and Select-to-Copy is respected there
  (#50).
- Team vaults: members who accepted an invitation while the vault owner was
  offline could be left without a vault key and silently unable to decrypt.
  Key distribution is now reconciled for those members (#41, #49).
- Audit log: the local per-vault log is capped, so a full quota can no longer
  silently stop recording new entries.
- Settings: the About-page links and the update-download button now open.
- Themes: on-accent text now picks its colour at the WCAG 0.179 luminance
  crossover, fixing low-contrast label text on some accent colours.
- Interface languages: corrected the Select-to-Copy setting description.

### Security

- Plugins: the gated capability tier — reading, watching, and typing into your
  terminal sessions, plus per-plugin keychain storage — is now grantable to
  third-party marketplace plugins behind explicit, danger-styled install-time
  consent. It was previously first-party-only. The install and update dialogs
  now show every declared permission in plain language, with the powerful ones
  called out in a separate warning block; a plugin that declares one always
  prompts for consent, even when install review is turned off. Command injection
  (`sessions.sendCommand`) moved from the public `sessions:write` permission to
  a new gated `terminal:write`, split from terminal reading. Keychain storage is
  now isolated per plugin (keys are namespaced `plugin:<id>:`), so one plugin can
  no longer read or overwrite another's secrets. No installed plugin gains
  anything without a fresh consent, and no shipped build exposed cross-plugin
  keychain data. Side-loaded and locally-scanned plugins still load without a
  consent prompt — writing to the plugins folder already implies full app
  privileges — so only install a local bundle you trust.
- Updated the bundled `quinn-proto` dependency to 0.11.15, picking up the fix
  for GHSA-4w2j-m93h-cj5j (#82).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Light/dark theme switching — switch manually from the Command Palette, the
  sidebar account menu, or Appearance settings, with live preview as you browse
- Automatic theme switching — follow the system appearance, a fixed schedule, or
  local sunrise/sunset
- New built-in "Voltius Light" theme
- Importing an SSH config now adopts existing matching connections instead of
  creating duplicates (#39)

### Changed

- Terminal behavior toggles (scrollback, minimap, select-to-copy, plain paste)
  now live in their own dedicated Terminal settings section (#37)

### Fixed

- Session cards no longer clip their shadows at the scroll edge (team and
  cross-device sessions)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Search within the Docker panel — a per-sub-tab find-bar filters resources live
  as you type, and Ctrl+F focuses it
- Redesigned snippet step editor — drag to reorder step cards with a clearer
  visual hierarchy, plus a slide-over picker for choosing remote paths

### Fixed

- Sync: a secret you changed locally is no longer overwritten by a stale copy
  from the server (#35)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Android: native IME bridge so the on-screen keyboard types into the terminal
  correctly, and the keyboard now dismisses when the terminal unmounts (#34)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Per-host notes — attach freeform notes to any host, kept in sync with the
  host's data
- Plain-paste toggle for the terminal — bypass bracketed paste when a remote
  program mishandles it
- Russian language support, selectable from the language picker in Appearance
  settings (#26)

### Fixed

- Country flag emoji now render as actual flags on Windows instead of
  two-letter codes (#31)
- Linux: worked around a WebKitGTK white-screen on AppImage under Wayland
- SSH: shell-integration wrappers now inherit the pty, so commands like
  `sudo -i` behave correctly

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Auto port-forwarding no longer hijacks a local port that another process
  already uses. On Windows, connecting to a Docker-published service on
  `127.0.0.1` (e.g. MongoDB on `27017`) could reach Voltius's tunnel instead of
  the real service; Voltius now detects the in-use port and falls back to the
  next free one (#33)

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- SSH Config Sync and GitHub Gist Sync no longer keep syncing after the plugin
  is disabled — a disabled plugin now stays fully inert (no file watcher, no
  background sync, no push on quit)
- SFTP file panes now remember the "show hidden files" setting across panes,
  sessions, and relaunches, so dotfiles stay visible once you enable them

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- macOS: the app bundle is now ad-hoc signed, so a directly downloaded `.dmg`
  no longer fails on Apple Silicon with "Voltius.app is damaged and cannot be
  opened"; the standard Gatekeeper prompt appears instead

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Multi-language support — the entire app can now run in French, selectable
  from a new language picker in Appearance settings (built on i18next)
- Snippet sequences — build multi-step snippets from script, file-transfer, and
  nested-snippet steps, run them across multiple hosts with variable prompts,
  choose a per-target conflict policy for transfers, and see a run-summary
  toast; includes a mobile step-list editor
- In-app bug reporting — generate a redacted diagnostics zip from a new
  Diagnostics settings section (or the command palette, dropdown, about page,
  and error toasts), backed by unified logging with a verbose toggle
- SFTP file-pane clipboard and keyboard navigation — copy/cut/paste files
  including across hosts, Explorer-style navigation keys (Backspace to go up,
  Alt-arrows for history, Home/End, Esc, F5 to refresh), and type-ahead search

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Windows OpenSSH sessions that connected but showed a blank terminal now fall
  back to a plain shell
- Host metrics sparklines reset when switching hosts, so a newly selected host
  no longer briefly shows the previous host's graph data

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- SFTP intra-pane drag-to-move — drag files within a pane, including onto
  parent and breadcrumb drop targets, in both the terminal SFTP panel and
  fullscreen panes

### Fixed

- Ports tab badge counts the current host instead of all sessions
- Port-forward tunnels are cancelled on teardown so the local listener is freed
- WSL distro is pre-warmed so cold-start sessions don't hang
- Git Bash launches correctly (the `--rcfile` argument is passed before `-i`)
- Docker stack services refresh on poll and after actions
- Dropped a redundant SFTP panel drag ghost

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Windows and macOS builds — renamed a mobile-terminal helper module so its
  filename no longer collides with a component file by letter case only, which
  broke the build on case-insensitive filesystems

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Port forwarding panel overhaul — inline quick-forward row to create ad-hoc
  tunnels, save ad-hoc/auto tunnels as named rules with inline rename, copy
  localhost:port from active tunnel rows, an active-tunnel count badge on the
  ports rail icon, and a panel header with active count and section labels
- Auto port-forwarding is now shared across all terminals of the same host
  instead of being set up per-terminal
- Mobile terminal gestures — swipe-to-scroll, long-press text selection with a
  copy/paste toolbar, blank-area paste, and double-tap for Tab
- OSC 52 clipboard support, with a shared copy/paste helper across the terminal
- Per-connection toggle for legacy SSH algorithms, for connecting to old devices
- SFTP "follow cwd" now works through tmux and screen by polling the multiplexer

### Fixed

- New-session host status dot now reflects true reachability
- Pane close button closes the session instead of just detaching it
- Mobile terminal toolbar fixes — Copy now works, the toolbar is positioned
  correctly and closes on teardown, and swipe-scroll no longer triggers a stray
  tap

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

  local files, and diff local↔remote or across hosts, powered by CodeMirror 6
  with syntax highlighting for many languages and theming from the app palette
- VS Code-style editor tab bar — drag tabs to reorder, drag a tab into the
  editor area to open a diff, tab overflow handling, and type icons
- Diff view with apply ribbons, prev/next chunk navigation, collapse-unchanged,
  editable diffs with undo/redo, and color-coded chunks (green add / red delete
  / yellow modified)
- Auto-save — global and per-editor toggle, manual or debounced save, and a
  configurable max file size
- Double-click to open, dirty-close guard, and non-destructive save-error
  handling
- FTP and FTPS support

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-18

  xdg-open, which the URL-opener plugin needs to bundle into the AppImage

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Voltius for Android — the full app now runs on Android (signed arm64 APK),

  self-update
- Install options: Homebrew cask, winget, apt/yum package repos, and a client
  `setup.sh`

### Fixed

- Linux: the keychain now persists via the Secret Service instead of volatile
  kernel keyutils
- Updater: surface install errors instead of silently restarting, guard against
  concurrent update checks, and stop reusing a cross-session disk cache

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-09

  object avatars now share consistent elevation, focus rings, and surfaces

### Fixed

- Closing a pane in a multi-pane tab now preserves its siblings
- Closing a multi-pane tab removes its sessions synchronously
- SSH falls back to POSIX sh integration when the remote lacks bash
