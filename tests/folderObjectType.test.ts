 * listing that object filters on, or the new folder lands on a different page
 * and the object looks unfiled. KeyForm and IdentityForm were copy-pasted from
 * the connection forms and created `"connection"` folders, which KeychainPage —
 * filtering on `"keychain"` — never shows.
 *
 * Asserted against source text rather than a render: the type is a prop threaded
 * into shared JSX with no seam to invoke, and a full render harness for these
 * forms costs far more than the invariant is worth. This catches the copy-paste,
 * not the runtime behaviour.
